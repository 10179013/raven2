The control software for the Raven Surgical Robotics Research Platform, developed primarily at the University of Washington, is open source.  This is the documentation.   Full source code is available on github at

<https://github.com/uw-biorobotics/raven2>

Eventually code from other Raven-II sites will be merged with this code-base to create a definitive Raven-II release.

You may purchase the Raven II from [Applied Dexterity Inc.](http://AppliedDexterity.com)
